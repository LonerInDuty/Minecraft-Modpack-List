## I want to follow in the footsteps of u/gurugeek42's amazing [List of short, story-driven modpacks](https://old.reddit.com/r/feedthebeast/comments/nhphd7/list_of_short_storydriven_modpacks/).

## Because 100+ hours for a Minecraft modpack is too long.

## Help me catalogue the playtime of these modpacks!

## 🎮 Adventure/Sandbox Packs (Not meant to be finished)

| Modpack | Version | Description |
|---------|---------|-------------|
| **[Raspberry Flavored](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/modpacks/raspberry-flavoured)** | 1.19.2 | Probably **the best "vanilla+" modpack that exists, and I don't say that lightly.** It truly redesigns the game, replacing bad/annoying mechanics with fully custom implementations. As [The Bottom Dweller](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wvIevmZ21FM) said: "It's like Minecraft from a parallel universe." |
| **[Rebirth of the Night](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/modpacks/rebirth-of-the-night)** | 1.12.2 | Also focuses on fixing Minecraft's design, but this one focuses on combat, danger, and exploration. Don't worry, it's not RLCraft. It just makes you actually care about defenses and survival. |
| **[MC Eternal 2](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/modpacks/mc-eternal-2)** | 1.20.1 | If you just want a big modpack with amazing mods, but actually configured nicely together and with a quest book that guides you through all of it, but never forces you to anything. |

## 🌱 Short, Beginner-Friendly Modpacks (Tech-focused, but story-driven)

| Modpack | Version |
|---------|---------|
| **[Cuboid Outpost Luxury Edition](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/modpacks/cuboid-outpost-le)** | 1.20.1 |
| **[CABIN: Create Above & Beyond In Newer](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/modpacks/cabin)** | 1.20.1 |
| **[Break Out](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/modpacks/breakout)** | 1.12.2 |
| **[Digsite](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/modpacks/digsite)** | 1.12.2 |
| **[Star Factory](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/modpacks/star-factory)** | 1.12.2 |
| **[Rustic Waters 2](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/modpacks/rustic-waters-ii)** | 1.16.5 |
| **[Material Energy 5](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/modpacks/material-energy-5-entity)** | 1.12.2 |
| **[Liminal Industries](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/modpacks/liminal-industries)** | 1.20.1 |

## **FOR BEGINNERS:** It seems the consensus is that **Cuboid Outpost Luxury** is the best modpack for beginners, and that it's pretty short at that, followed by **CABIN - Create Above and Beyond In Newer** .

## But all of the above are said to be short, beginner-friendly, and even story-driven!

## Just remember to add Embeddium to Cuboid.

## 📖 Story-Focused Tech Modpacks

| Modpack | Version | Playtime |
|---------|---------|----------|
| **[Blightfall](https://www.technicpack.net/modpack/blightfall.592618)** | 1.7.10 | 200+ hours |
| **[Regrowth](https://www.technicpack.net/modpack/regrowth-an-hqm-pack-rld.1025833)** | 1.7.10 | ??? |

These are the ones I've seen the most. I've heard Blightfall takes 200+ hours, but couldn't find anything on Regrowth.

## 🏆 Expert Packs (Kitchen-sink, but with quests, custom progression and still tech-focused)

| Modpack | Version | Playtime | Description |
|---------|---------|----------|-------------|
| **[MeatballCraft](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/modpacks/meatballcraft)** | 1.12.2 | 2000+ hours | Possibly the holy grail of content. Massive number of mods—adventure, combat, exploration, and tech—all configured to be cohesive with guided, gated progression. |
| **[Enigmatica 2 Expert Unofficial](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/modpacks/e2eu)** | 1.12.2 | 300+ hours | Comparable to MeatballCraft in design philosophy, just smaller in scope due to being old, with the Unofficial version improving many aspects. |
| **[Divine Journey 2](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/modpacks/divine-journey-2)** | 1.12.2 | 600+ hours |  |

## ⚙️ GregTech & Greg-Like Modpacks

| Modpack | Version | Playtime | Notes |
|---------|---------|----------|-------|
| **[StaTech Industry](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/modpacks/statech-industry)** | 1.19.2 | 200+ hours | Uses Modern Industrialization, not GregTech |
| **[Monifactory](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/modpacks/monifactory)** | 1.20.1 | 400+ hours | A sort of reimagining of Nomifactory with the same principles. Still in development, so less polished than Nomifactory CEu. |
| **[Nomifactory CEu](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/modpacks/nomi-ceu)** | 1.12.2 | 600+ hours | The original Omnifactory, and by extension Nomifactory are meant to be GregTech but without grind, **AND** adding other tech mods to achieve that. |
| **[Star Technology](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/modpacks/star-technology)** | 1.20.1 | ??? | Modern GregTech plus other mods on Skyblock. |
| **[GregTech Community Pack Modern](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/modpacks/gregtech-community-pack-modern)** | 1.20.1 | 600+ hours | Designed as a beginner tutorial for GregTech |
| **[GregTech New Horizons](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/modpacks/gt-new-horizons)** | 1.7.10 | 3000+ hours | Unemploynium |

**StaTech Industry** is said to be good, even outside of comparing Modern Industrialization to GregTech. Seems like the best option if you want a taste of GregTech, it's the shorter one.
